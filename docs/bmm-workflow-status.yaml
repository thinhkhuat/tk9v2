# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Initial Status (before completion):
#   - required: Must be completed to progress
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - recommended: Strongly suggested but not required
#   - conditional: Required only if certain conditions met (e.g., if_has_ui)
#
# Completion Status:
#   - {file-path}: File created/found (e.g., "docs/product-brief.md")
#   - skipped: Optional/conditional workflow that was skipped

# RESEARCH GUIDANCE FOR AGENTS:
# ==============================
# The following MCP servers are available and SHOULD be used for research workflows:
#
# 1. ARCHON MCP SERVER (mcp__archon__*)
#    - Personal curated knowledge base with RAG capabilities
#    - Precisely curated, fast, and efficient
#    - Contains project-specific documentation and patterns
#    - Use for: Project-specific research, established patterns, curated best practices
#
# 2. CONTEXT7 MCP SERVER (mcp__context7__*)
#    - Broad generic knowledge base with official documentation
#    - Covers ALL major software libraries and frameworks
#    - Vast coverage but less personalized
#    - Use for: Official documentation research, framework APIs, standard library references
#    - Tools: resolve-library-id (find library), get-library-docs (fetch docs)
#
# 3. SUPABASE MCP SERVER (mcp__supabase__*)
#    - Direct access to personal Supabase database
#    - View existing schemas, tables, and database structure
#    - Contains existing implementations that can serve as reference
#    - Use for: Database schema analysis, existing auth patterns, reference implementations
#
# RESEARCH STRATEGY:
# - Start with Archon for curated, project-specific patterns
# - Use Context7 for official framework/library documentation
# - Use Supabase MCP to understand existing database structure and patterns
# - Archon and Context7 both contain Supabase documentation, but Supabase MCP provides direct database access
